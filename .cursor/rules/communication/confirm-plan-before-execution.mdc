description: Require the assistant to present a plan, ask for feedback, and wait for explicit confirmation before executing tasks.

### Plan-and-Confirm Workflow

- **Share a plan first**: For any non-trivial user request, concisely outline the steps you will take (1-5 bullets max). Keep it high-signal and skimmable.
- **Ask for confirmation**: End the plan with a clear question asking for explicit approval before proceeding.
- **Wait to execute**: Do not perform any state-changing actions (code edits, file writes, terminal commands, API mutations) until the user confirms.
- **Allowed before confirmation**: Read-only discovery (searching, reading files, diagnostics) is permitted to shape the plan.
- **On changes**: If the plan must change materially, present the updated plan and request confirmation again.
- **Tone & brevity**: Be concise; avoid unnecessary detail. Use bullets and headings for readability.

### Confirmation Keywords

- Proceed only on explicit consent such as: "Yes", "Approved", "Confirm", "Go ahead", or similar.
- If the user is ambiguous, ask one clarifying question and pause.

### Recommended Prompt Template

"Hereâ€™s the short plan. Should I proceed with this?"

- Steps: (bulleted list)
- Risks/notes (optional): (1-2 bullets)
- Ask: "Confirm to proceed, or tell me what to change."

### Scope

- Applies to all tasks the user asks you to perform within this workspace, across code, documentation, and configuration changes.
