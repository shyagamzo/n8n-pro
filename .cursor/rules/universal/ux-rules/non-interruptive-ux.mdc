# Non-Interruptive UX Guidelines

## Core Principle: Never Force Context Switching

Applications should **never interrupt** the user's current workflow or thought process. Users should always feel in control of their experience.

## Agent and UX Principles

### Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Specialized Agents**: Use different agents for different responsibilities (Classifier, Enrichment, Planner, Executor)
- **Orchestration**: Coordinate agents through a central orchestrator
- **Ambiguity Handling**: Do not assume defaults, ask one clarifying question at a time
- **Preference for Simplicity**: Use simple tools when sufficient, reserve complexity for complex tasks

### Credential and Configuration Guidance
- **Non-Interruptive Setup**: Detect missing credentials, show optional setup button
- **Parallel Guidance**: Guidance runs in parallel, never blocks main workflow
- **Optional Actions**: Provide optional actions (buttons/links) rather than forcing processes

## Key Guidelines:

### 1. **Optional Actions Only**
- Show clickable buttons/links for additional features
- Never force users into setup or configuration processes
- Always allow users to continue their primary task

### 2. **Parallel Processes**
- When additional guidance is needed, run it in parallel
- Don't block the main workflow or process
- Users can engage with guidance when they're ready

### 3. **Context Preservation**
- Maintain the user's current focus and intent
- Don't force them to think about something else mid-task
- Preserve their mental model and workflow state

### 4. **Progressive Disclosure**
- Show relevant options when appropriate
- Hide complexity until needed
- Let users choose their level of engagement

## Examples:
- ✅ Show "Setup configuration" button when needed
- ❌ Popup blocking main process for setup
- ✅ Parallel guidance that doesn't interrupt main flow
- ❌ Forcing users to complete setup before continuing

## Application:
This principle applies to all features: setup processes, optimization suggestions, recommendations, and any other guidance the application provides.

## What NOT to do:
- Force context switching mid-task
- Block primary workflows for secondary concerns
- Overwhelm users with multiple simultaneous requests
