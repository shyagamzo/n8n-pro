# AI Integration Patterns

## Multi-Agent Architecture
The extension uses a multi-agent system with specialized roles:

### Agent Types
- **Classifier Agent**: Determines user intent and routes to appropriate agent
- **Enrichment Agent**: Gathers additional context and asks clarifying questions
- **Planner Agent**: Creates step-by-step plans for complex tasks
- **Executor Agent**: Performs actions and executes workflows
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates between agents and manages the conversation flow

## LLM Integration
- **Use LangChainJS** for LLM provider abstraction
- **Support multiple providers** (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- **Implement streaming responses** for better UX
- **Handle rate limiting** and retry logic
- **Cache responses** when appropriate

## Message Flow
```
User Input → Classifier → Enrichment → Planner → Executor → Response
                ↓
            Orchestrator (coordinates all agents)
```

## n8n API Integration
- **Use custom fetch wrapper** with retry logic and error handling
- **Implement proper authentication** with API keys
- **Handle rate limiting** and connection issues
- **Validate API responses** before processing
- **Cache frequently accessed data**

## Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation** when AI services are unavailable
- **Fallback responses** for common scenarios
- **User-friendly error messages** with actionable suggestions
- **Logging and monitoring** for debugging

## Security Considerations
- **Never expose API keys** in client-side code
- **Validate all user input** before sending to AI services
- **Sanitize AI responses** before displaying to users
- **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Use secure communication** for all API calls

## Performance Optimization
- **Stream responses** for long-running operations
- **Cache common responses** to reduce API calls
- **Implement request deduplication** for identical queries
- **Use background processing** for non-critical operations
- **Optimize payload sizes** for faster transmission
