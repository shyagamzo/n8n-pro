# Decision Record: n8n Extension Use Case — Creativity Suggestions

## Intent
Help experienced users discover automation opportunities by proposing concrete, runnable workflow ideas tailored to their context, tools, and habits.

## Behavior
- Chatbot starts with a simple LLM greeting; user may ask for ideas or describe a pain point.
- Classifier routes to Planner; Enrichment asks one question at a time if the request is vague.
- Planner proposes 2–3 workflow ideas with brief pros/cons and required credentials.
- Non-interruptive UX: present ideas as selectable cards; credential guidance offered as optional buttons.
- On selection, Planner → Executor generate a draft workflow and show a diff preview.
 - Context gathering: automatically fetch the list of existing workflows on panel open; fetch credentials only on demand when an idea is selected or details are requested.

## Idea Sources (MVP)
- Common personal productivity patterns (calendar, reminders, email triage)
- Local context signals (visible n8n workspace, recent workflows)
- User-provided tools/services
- Existing workflows, credentials, and available tools should be reused by default when relevant

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each idea includes: summary, trigger, key nodes, data flow, required credentials
- Selecting an idea creates a draft workflow with a runnable skeleton

## Constraints
- No proactive, heavy analysis; keep suggestions lightweight unless asked
- Credential setup remains optional and parallel
 - Reuse existing workflows/credentials/tools when possible to minimize setup and duplication

## Open Items
- How to inject minimal context without being intrusive
- Ranking criteria for ideas (impact vs effort)
