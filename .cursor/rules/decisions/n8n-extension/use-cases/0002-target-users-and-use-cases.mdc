# Decision Record: n8n Extension Target Users & Use Cases

## Decision
Primary target users: Experienced n8n users seeking speed and reduced friction in building/modifying workflows.

## Rationale
- These users already understand n8n primitives and need acceleration, not tutorials.
- Highest impact: shorten iteration cycles and reduce boilerplate for complex builds.

## Implications
- Default to concise, low-latency interactions and minimal hand-holding.
- Prefer regular tools over AI where simpler/faster; reserve multi-agent plans for complex tasks.
- Surface optional, non-interruptive credential guidance (do not block).
- Provide typed, diff-style previews for workflow edits to enable fast review.

## Open Questions
- Which metrics define “speed” (time-to-first-node, time-to-working-run, runs-to-green, etc.)?
- What shortcuts/commands do power users expect (e.g., quick-add nodes, connect chains)?

## Next Step
Define primary use cases for experienced users and success metrics.
 
## Primary Use Cases (agreed)
1. Creating an initial workflow
2. Improving workflow edge cases
3. Solving situations with no built-in n8n support
4. Creativity: suggesting workflows as optimization solutions for daily problems

## Deferred
- Metrics instrumentation and local dashboard are deferred to a future version to avoid complicating the MVP.
