# Decision Record: n8n Extension Agent and UX Principles

This document centralizes how the n8n extension (its LLM agents and UI) should behave.

## Agent Principles
- Multi-agent architecture: Classifier, Enrichment (one-question-at-a-time), Planner, Executor; Orchestrator coordinates.
- Ambiguity handling: Do not assume defaults (e.g., triggers). Ask one clarifying question at a time via Enrichment.
- Preference for simplicity: Use regular n8n tools when sufficient; reserve multi-agent complexity for complex tasks.
- Credential guidance: Detect missing credentials, show optional setup button, guidance runs in parallel; never block.

## UX Principles
- Non-interruptive UX: Never force context switching; provide optional actions (buttons/links).
- Consistent entry: Trigger button opens chatbot; initial LLM greeting; wait for user intent.

## Notes
- Metrics instrumentation is deferred for a future version.
- Session storage for chat to be discussed later.
