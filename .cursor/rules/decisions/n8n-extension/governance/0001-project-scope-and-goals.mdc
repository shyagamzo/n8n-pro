# Decision Record: n8n Extension Project Scope & Goals

## Summary
Build a Chrome/Edge extension that injects a trigger button into locally hosted n8n. Clicking it opens a floating chatbot panel. The chatbot is an LLM-powered multi-agent system that can create and improve n8n workflows and facilitate credential setup with non-interruptive UX.

## Goals
- Speed up workflow creation for both simple and highly complex workflows
- Optimize existing workflows for performance and maintainability
- Detect missing credentials and provide interactive, step-by-step setup guidance
- Maintain a non-interruptive, optional-engagement UX throughout
- Start every session with an LLM-generated simple greeting

## Non-Goals (for now)
- Automatic/provider-side credential creation or OAuth project provisioning
- Workflow template catalog/marketplace
- Proactive page analysis before user input

## Users
- All skill levels: beginners to power users building and improving workflows locally

## High-Level Capabilities
- LLM chatbot with agent network: Classifier, Enrichment (one-question-at-a-time), Planner, Executor; Orchestrator manages flow
- n8n API integration for reading/updating workflows and checking credentials
- Credential guidance launched via optional buttons; runs in parallel to main task
- Session persistence for chats (to be designed later)

## UX Principles
- Non-interruptive UX: do not force context switches; offer optional buttons/links
- One-question-at-a-time when gathering clarification

## Open Questions / Next
- Define Target Users & Use Cases in detail
- Storage design for chat sessions and state
- Initial tech stack choices for extension scaffold and LLM provider
