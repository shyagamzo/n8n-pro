# Implementation Readiness Guidelines

Complete planning before implementation. Ensure all necessary decisions are made and documented.

## Readiness Criteria:
- **Decision Completeness**: All major architectural decisions documented
- **Scope Clarity**: Clear MVP boundaries, acceptance criteria, dependencies
- **Implementation Path**: Step-by-step plan, dev environment, testing strategy

## Readiness Checklist:
- [ ] Project scope and goals defined
- [ ] Technical architecture specified
- [ ] All major technical decisions made
- [ ] Development environment setup defined
- [ ] Coding standards established
- [ ] Git workflow defined

## When to Start:
- **Green Light**: All planning complete, user approval, clear path
- **Yellow Light**: Most planning done, minor decisions pending, clear scope
- **Red Light**: Major decisions pending, unclear scope, no user approval

## Start Process:
1. **Confirm Readiness**: Review completion, verify user approval
2. **Set Scope**: Define first components, establish boundaries
3. **Begin Foundation**: Dev environment, core infrastructure, project structure

## What NOT to do:
- Start without completing planning
- Code without clear specifications
- Implement without user approval
- Skip foundation setup
