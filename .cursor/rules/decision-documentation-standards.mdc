# Decision Documentation Standards

Document every significant decision with sufficient detail for future reference.

## Requirements:
- **File naming**: `0001-decision-name.md`, `0002-next-decision.md` in `decisions/` directory
- **Structure**: Context, Decision, Implementation Details, Alternatives, Consequences, References
- **Content**: Be specific, include examples, document reasoning, reference context
- **Updates**: Update when implementation changes, cross-reference related decisions

## Document These Patterns:
- **Technical**: Framework choices, architecture, API design, configuration
- **Process**: Development workflow, testing, documentation, Git workflow
- **UX/Design**: User interactions, visual design, accessibility, error handling

## What NOT to do:
- Create vague or incomplete records
- Skip implementation details
- Forget to reference related decisions
- Leave records outdated
