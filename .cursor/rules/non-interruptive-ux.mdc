# Non-Interruptive UX Guidelines

## Core Principle: Never Force Context Switching

The extension should **never interrupt** the user's current workflow or thought process. Users should always feel in control of their experience.

## Key Guidelines:

### 1. **Optional Actions Only**
- Show clickable buttons/links for additional features
- Never force users into credential setup or other processes
- Always allow users to continue their primary task

### 2. **Parallel Processes**
- When additional guidance is needed, run it in parallel
- Don't block the main workflow creation process
- Users can engage with guidance when they're ready

### 3. **Context Preservation**
- Maintain the user's current focus and intent
- Don't force them to think about something else mid-task
- Preserve their mental model and workflow state

### 4. **Progressive Disclosure**
- Show relevant options when appropriate
- Hide complexity until needed
- Let users choose their level of engagement

## Examples:
- ✅ Show "Setup Gmail credentials" button when Gmail node is added
- ❌ Popup blocking workflow creation for credential setup
- ✅ Parallel credential guidance that doesn't interrupt workflow building
- ❌ Forcing users to complete credential setup before continuing

## Application:
This principle applies to all features: credential setup, workflow optimization suggestions, AI agent recommendations, and any other guidance the extension provides.

## Integration with Other Rules:
- Always reference [project-context-awareness.mdc](mdc:project-context-awareness.mdc) for project-specific context
- Use [communication-clarity.mdc](mdc:communication-clarity.mdc) for clear user interaction design
- Follow [ambiguity-handling.mdc](mdc:ambiguity-handling.mdc) for handling ambiguous user requests
