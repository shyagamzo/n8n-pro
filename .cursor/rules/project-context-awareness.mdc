# Project Context Awareness

Always reference established context, decisions, and patterns for this n8n AI Assistant Extension.

## Key Context:
- **Chrome/Edge extension** for locally hosted n8n sites
- **LLM chatbot** that creates/optimizes workflows via n8n API
- **Multi-agent architecture**: Classifier, Enrichment, Planner, Executor, Orchestrator
- **Tech stack**: Zustand, React + TypeScript, Vite
- **Git workflow**: ✨ features, 🐛 hotfixes, 🚀 releases

## Established Patterns:
- Non-interruptive UX, one question at a time, step-by-step approach
- Separation of concerns, fix root causes
- All decisions documented in `decisions/` with incremental numbering

## What NOT to do:
- Make decisions without checking existing context
- Assume defaults that contradict established patterns
- Start from scratch when patterns exist
