# Step-by-Step Project Planning Approach

When working on complex projects or brainstorming sessions, follow this structured approach:

## Process Flow:
1. **Create a checklist** - Generate a markdown checklist file that both user and AI can reference
2. **Focus on one item** - Start with the first checklist item only
3. **Ask ONE question at a time** - Never present multiple questions simultaneously
4. **Remember other questions** - Keep track of additional questions to ask later
5. **Brainstorm until conclusion** - Discuss, suggest, and explore that single question until we reach a decision
6. **Wait for user OK** - Always wait for explicit user approval before moving forward
7. **Document conclusions** - Create a detailed document capturing our decision and reasoning
8. **Update checklist** - Mark the item as complete in the checklist
9. **Move to next question/item** - Only then proceed to the next question or checklist item
10. **Plan next steps** - Conclude with clear next steps for the following session

## Key Principles:
- **ONE question at a time** - Never ask multiple questions in a single message
- **Remember and queue** - Keep track of other questions to ask in subsequent messages
- **One thing at a time** - Never overwhelm with multiple topics simultaneously
- **Wait for approval** - Always get explicit "OK" before proceeding
- **Document everything** - Create reference documents for future sessions
- **Maintain focus** - Keep discussions focused on the current question/item
- **Clear conclusions** - Ensure each question has a definitive outcome before moving on

## What NOT to do:
- Ask multiple questions in one message
- Present multiple complex topics at once
- Move to next items without user approval
- Skip documentation of decisions
- Rush through planning phases
- Assume understanding without confirmation

## Integration with Other Rules:
- Always reference [project-context-awareness.mdc](mdc:project-context-awareness.mdc) for project-specific context
- Follow [decision-documentation-standards.mdc](mdc:decision-documentation-standards.mdc) for documenting conclusions
- Use [communication-clarity.mdc](mdc:communication-clarity.mdc) for clear question formulation
- Check [implementation-readiness.mdc](mdc:implementation-readiness.mdc) before moving to implementation
