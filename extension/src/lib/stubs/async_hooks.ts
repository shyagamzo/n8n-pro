/**
 * Browser-compatible AsyncLocalStorage polyfill.
 *
 * LangGraph requires AsyncLocalStorage to maintain execution context for features like interrupt().
 * This implementation provides a working polyfill for browser environments where Node.js's
 * async_hooks module is not available.
 *
 * Limitations:
 * - Does not track context across async boundaries like native AsyncLocalStorage
 * - Works for LangGraph's synchronous context propagation within runnables
 * - Context is maintained as long as execution stays within the run() callback chain
